/**
 * Like `fs.mkdir({ recursive: true })` but also repairs broken symlinks and
 * junctions whose target no longer exists (a Windows edge-case where the user
 * had a junction at e.g. `~/.cssltdcode` pointing to a deleted directory).
 *
 * `fs.mkdir({ recursive: true })` silently no-ops when a junction exists even
 * if its target is gone, so subsequent writes inside that path fail with ENOENT.
 * We detect this by calling `fs.stat` (which follows the symlink/junction) after
 * mkdir: if stat fails the entry is broken and we remove + recreate it.
