Resolve the manual part of an upstream merge.

**Do not load the `cssltdcode-merge-minimizer` skill.** That skill is for
authoring new Cssltd changes against shared upstream files; during an upstream
merge it gives the wrong guidance (it nudges toward extracting Cssltd logic out
of conflict regions, which is exactly the opposite of what merge resolution
needs). Follow the rules in this agent file instead.

The user will provide the upstream version (for example `v1.1.50` or `1.1.50`)
in their first message. If they don't, infer it from the current branch name,
from `upstream-merge-report-<version>.md`, or from the newest relevant report
file.

## Workflow

### 1. Inspect the current merge state

- `git status --short`
- `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`
- `upstream-merge-report-<version>.md` when present
- `.worktrees/cssltdcode-merge/auto-merge` for the automated merge snapshot when present

### 2. Read every conflicted file end-to-end before planning

Use `script/upstream/find-conflict-markers.sh <file>` to jump to each region,
then read enough surrounding lines to understand the code — not just the
conflict hunk. Specifically check:

- is this a plain 3-way on a single expression, or a structural refactor?
- does upstream rename/move something that invalidates a HEAD-only declaration?
- does a `cssltdcode_change` marker in HEAD encode a bug fix, a feature, or a
  defensive check?
- is the conflicted block referenced by *non-conflicted* code elsewhere in the
  same file (imports, signatures, call sites) that will break if we drop it?

When HEAD includes a non-obvious Cssltd-specific wrapper (e.g. a helper in
`packages/cssltdcode/src/cssltdcode/`), find out why it exists before deciding to
keep or bypass it:

```bash
git log --all --oneline -S "<symbol>" -- packages/cssltdcode/src/cssltdcode/
git log --all --oneline -- <cssltd-file>
```

Look at the commit message and any PR reference. "We wrote our own because of
PR #NNNN" is a real constraint; "we wrote our own because of a typo" is not.

When upstream narrows an externally-visible compatibility list (models,
providers, routes, config keys, file formats), verify the intent from upstream
PRs, issues, release notes, or current docs before dropping entries. Treat
silent list shrinkage during a refactor as suspicious until proven intentional.

### 3. Write a plan in chat and get approval

For every conflicted file (and any adjacent file the resolution forces you to
touch — see §6) include:

- expected resolution kind: `hybrid`, `take-ours`, `take-theirs`, `regenerated`,
  `removed`, `renamed`, or `other`
- risk level: `low`, `medium`, or `high`
- one-sentence rationale (what Cssltd behaviour is preserved, what upstream
  feature is adopted, what is dropped)
- verification commands you expect to run (targeted tests, typecheck)

Group files by risk level. Ask the user which batch to start with. You can
resolve an entire `low` batch in one pass if the user approves the batch, but
resolve `medium` and `high` files one at a time.

**Do not resolve a file until the user has approved that file's (or batch's)
strategy.**

### 4. Before every edit, explain reasoning before showing the diff

The user needs to review intent, not just the raw change. For each file, in
order:

1. Show the conflict's surrounding context (10–30 lines around each conflict
   region, in chat).
2. Explain what each of the three sides (HEAD, merge-base, upstream) is doing.
3. State which Cssltd behaviour must survive and why (reference PR numbers /
   `cssltdcode_change` comments when possible).
4. State the resolution and why it is better than the alternatives.
5. Then apply the edit. The tool will display the diff — the user only has to
   verify the diff matches the reasoning.

Do not lead with the diff. A diff without reasoning forces the user to
reverse-engineer the decision.

### 5. Apply resolution rules

Reference worktrees when present:

- `.worktrees/cssltdcode-merge/cssltdcode` — pristine upstream tree
- `.worktrees/cssltdcode-merge/cssltd-main` — Cssltd base snapshot
- `.worktrees/cssltdcode-merge/auto-merge` — automated merge snapshot (original
  conflict reference)

Apply in order:

- prefer upstream code and architecture whenever compatible with Cssltd behaviour
- preserve Cssltd-specific behaviour marked with `cssltdcode_change`
- keep `cssltdcode_change` markers around Cssltd-specific code in shared cssltdcode
  files
- when upstream refactors a region that HEAD had annotated with
  `cssltdcode_change`, **check whether the marker encodes a bug fix or a feature
  delta**. Bug fixes (missing `await`, defensive null-check, error capture)
  usually need to be re-applied on top of the upstream refactor. Example from
  v1.14.30: `Workspace.isSyncing` was missing an `await` — upstream's Effect
  refactor reintroduced the same bug, so we had to port the fix into the new
  `Effect.gen` block.
- when a `take-theirs` drops a line that was the target of a Cssltd pre-filter,
  the upstream line may be actively wrong for Cssltd — e.g. an inner `continue`
  filter whose condition collides with an outer filter Cssltd added. Re-read the
  surrounding 20 lines before committing to `take-theirs`.
- if Cssltd-specific code must be refactored to fit new upstream architecture,
  explain the refactor in the final summary
- if upstream moved the relevant logic to another file, port the Cssltd behaviour
  there and list both paths in the final summary. Verify the new file already
  carries the Cssltd-renamed symbols (e.g. `x-cssltd-directory`) by diffing against
  pristine upstream.
- if upstream extracts shared policy into a helper, move Cssltd-specific additions
  into the helper when possible instead of keeping a pre-check at the old call
  site. The extracted helper should stay the source of truth for all callers.
- if upstream deleted a file, analyse whether the Cssltd behaviour should be
  ported elsewhere or removed rather than restoring the deleted file
- if tests fail only because upstream intentionally removed behaviour, remove
  or update the obsolete tests rather than adding the old file back
- do not modify unrelated files

When removing code that existed in one side of a conflict, prefer
**commenting it out with `cssltdcode_change` markers** over deletion when the
surrounding structure (an `if`, a loop) still makes sense. That keeps the
intent visible to the next merger. Example:

```ts
} else if (input?.scope !== "project" && !Flag.CSSLTD_EXPERIMENTAL_WORKSPACES) {
  // cssltdcode_change start - directory filtering handled by CssltdSession.filters above
  // if (input?.directory) {
  //   conditions.push(eq(SessionTable.directory, input.directory))
  // }
  // cssltdcode_change end
}
```

Use `TODO:` not `NOTE:` for follow-ups. `TODO` is searchable and implies an
owner will act on it; `NOTE` reads as permanent commentary.

### 6. Look for adjacent files the conflict forces you to touch

Upstream restructures sometimes split one file into several (e.g. `permission.ts`
→ `groups/permission.ts` + `handlers/permission.ts`). Only the *renamed* file
shows up in `git diff --diff-filter=U`; the new sibling may need a Cssltd feature
ported in too. After resolving the flagged file, check:

- files that import from the resolved file — do they compile?
- files at paths implied by new imports (e.g. `../middleware/*`, `./handlers/*`)
- `cssltdcode_change` comments in the *auto-merge* snapshot that didn't end up in
  the working tree because the hosting file was renamed

Add any such files to the plan as `hybrid` or `take-ours` with the same
approval flow.

### 6.5. Scan auto-merged files for latent bugs

Files not in `--diff-filter=U` merged without conflict markers but may still
be broken. Check every auto-merged file for:

- **Duplicate declarations in the same scope.** If both sides added equivalent
  code independently, auto-merge keeps both. Grep touched functions for
  repeated identifiers before trusting the merge.
- **Duplicate keys in config/manifest files.** If both sides added the same
  entry to a shared manifest (dependencies, scripts, workflow lists), the
  merged file may have the key twice. This often breaks install/setup before
  any test runs — a cheap early win to scan for.
- **Orphaned imports and references.** A rename upstream may leave a Cssltd
  callsite pointing at a now-missing export. Run full typecheck from the repo
  root; references that silently survived the merge surface there.
- **Partial auto-merges.** Upstream may have refactored a region Cssltd
  deliberately stubbed out (commented blocks, removed fallbacks). If the
  auto-merge pulled in references to names that only exist in the removed
  path, the file compiles upstream but breaks on Cssltd.

### 7. Verify each resolution before moving on

- confirm `script/upstream/find-conflict-markers.sh <file>` prints nothing
- read the final file region (the new shape after edit) and sanity-check imports
- for apparently-unused symbols upstream introduced, `grep` the file and the
  rest of the package before deleting — they may be called from non-conflicted
  code elsewhere. Example: `isTheme` in `theme.tsx` looked unused at the
  resolution site but was called twice further down.
- run the smallest relevant check (single `bun test` file, or `bun run
  typecheck` in the touched package)
- summarise the exact resolution, tradeoff, and verification result in chat
- ask the user to approve the resolved file before staging it or resolving the
  next one (for `medium` / `high`; `low` batches can be staged together)

### 8. Run the full checks once everything is resolved

- `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U` returns empty
- `bun run typecheck` from `packages/cssltdcode/` (targeted) and from repo root
  (catches non-conflicted call-site breakage)
- relevant targeted tests. Tests that hang or time out in an unrelated part of
  the graph may be pre-existing — note them, don't block the merge on them
- `bun run script/check-cssltdcode-annotations.ts` if `packages/cssltdcode/` shared
  files changed. Note that this tool compares against the merge base via `HEAD`
  and will be silent until the merge commit lands
- other CI guards that touched files imply (knip for `cssltd-vscode/`,
  `check-cssltdcode-change`, source-links, visual regression,
  `script/check-forbidden-strings.ts`)
- if you encounter a hardcoded upstream URL, repo path, or attribution string
  during conflict resolution that obviously shouldn't ship in Cssltd (e.g. another
  `https://cssltdcode.ai/...` link, an `anomalyco/cssltdcode` reference, an
  attribution header naming "cssltdcode"), suggest adding a literal pattern for
  it to `script/check-forbidden-strings.ts` in the merge summary so future
  merges catch it automatically. Don't add it silently mid-merge — flag it for
  the user.

### 9. Commit with the standard message

Per `script/upstream/README.md`:

```bash
git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts"
```

The default `git merge` auto-message (`Merge branch '…' into …`) is also fine,
but `resolve merge conflicts` is the convention for these PRs.

### 9.5. Handle downstream API renames as separate commits

Upstream often renames exported APIs. The rename itself auto-merges cleanly in
shared code, but the change cascades into Cssltd-only files (cssltdcode tests,
cssltd-specific source, plugins) that still reference the old symbol. Those
files don't appear in `--diff-filter=U` because their own content didn't
conflict.

Keep the behavioural merge commit focused on resolution decisions. Land the
cascade in one or more follow-up commits:

- after the merge commit, run full repo typecheck and collect every "cannot
  find name" / "property does not exist" error
- bulk-rename with a mechanical transform when the rename is one-to-one
- restructure or parameter-thread when upstream changed semantics, not just
  the name (e.g. moved a helper behind a dependency-injected surface, so
  callers now need the injected handle)
- split large downstream refactors into their own commits with messages that
  name the rename

Reviewers can then skim the behavioural commit without untangling mechanical
rename noise from merge decisions.

### 9.6. Handle upstream-added tests that diverge from Cssltd

Upstream sometimes adds tests that encode design contracts Cssltd intentionally
breaks. These auto-merge cleanly and then fail. Three resolution patterns:

- **Rewrite the test** when the test is a contract assertion and Cssltd has a
  different but equally valid contract. Invert or adjust the assertion with a
  `cssltdcode_change` marker explaining the divergence.
- **Skip the test** when the test relies on patterns that Cssltd has replaced
  (interception seams that are bypassed by dependency injection, fixture
  helpers bound to a removed API, assumptions about serialization shape that
  Cssltd's extensions break). Mark with `cssltdcode_change` and a rationale
  explaining what would need to change for the test to run.
- **Delete the test** when it covers functionality Cssltd deliberately removed
  (fallback paths, deprecated endpoints, products Cssltd doesn't ship). Note
  the deletion in the PR body.

Never silently delete; always leave a breadcrumb. A future reviewer should be
able to understand why this one upstream test is treated differently.

### 10. Resync version strings in a separate commit

Upstream stamps its own version into shared files — notably
`packages/extensions/zed/extension.toml` (version field + 5 Cssltd-Org download
URLs), and any `package.json` that upstream bumped in the same release window.
After the merge this leaves parts of the tree pointing at upstream's version
(e.g. `1.14.30`), whose release tag does not exist on Cssltd's pipeline, so the
Zed download URLs silently 404.

Fix this in a dedicated commit *after* `resolve merge conflicts`:

```bash
bun run script/sync-versions.ts             # uses root package.json version
# or, to target an explicit version:
bun run script/sync-versions.ts 7.2.41
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: resync versions after upstream merge"
```

The script rewrites every top-level `"version"` in `package.json` files
(excluding `node_modules`, hidden dirs, and `packages/cssltd-jetbrains/` which
tracks its own cadence), plus the Zed extension toml. It is idempotent — rerun
it any time to rebase the version back onto Cssltd main (useful during
long-running upstream merges where `main` releases in the meantime).

Keeping this in its own commit makes reviewers' job easier: the merge commit
only contains behavioural resolutions, and the version resync is a trivial
diff they can skim in one glance.

### 11. Write the PR body

Structure the description so reviewers can skim:

- **Non-trivial merge decisions**: a short section per file (or group of
  related files) that required more than a mechanical `take-ours`/`take-theirs`.
  Focus on *what Cssltd behaviour survived* and *what upstream features were
  adopted*. Link to Cssltd PRs when a `cssltdcode_change` encodes a specific fix.
- **Notable auto-merged changes**: new columns, new helper files, renamed
  middleware — anything reviewers should eyeball even though git didn't flag
  it.
- **What to test**: explicit, scenario-level test steps for each non-trivial
  change. Don't list tests; list *user-visible behaviour* so a tester who
  doesn't read the diff can exercise it.
- **CI guards to watch**: typecheck, knip, annotation check, visual regression.
- **Follow-ups**: any `TODO:` you left in code, as a bullet list with links.

## User-approval checkpoints

Every manual merge decision requires explicit user approval **before applying**
and **again after verification**. Be especially cautious when a decision is
destructive, changes auth, billing, data deletion, public API compatibility,
config schema behaviour, migrations, provider routing, or security posture.

## Common pitfalls

- Auto-merged code can reference declarations that still live inside conflict
  blocks.
- Related sibling files can need edits even when they are not listed as
  unmerged — especially after upstream structural splits.
- `renamed` should be used only when behaviour moves to a different file.
- Function signatures can drift across conflict boundaries (args added, return
  types widened). Grep for every call site before finalising.
- Full-repo typecheck is the catch-all for non-conflicted call-site breakage.
- Upstream can reintroduce bugs a Cssltd `cssltdcode_change` had already fixed —
  during big refactors check every `cssltdcode_change` the refactor touched.
- "Take-theirs" on an inner conditional is often wrong when Cssltd added an outer
  pre-filter whose whole point was to widen what makes it to the inner block.
- Apparently-unused upstream-added declarations may be called from
  non-conflicted code elsewhere. Grep before deleting.
- Stricter DOM lib types (upstream TS upgrade) can surface latent casting
  issues around `WebSocket.send`, `Headers`, etc. — prefer narrowing the Cssltd
  type over adding `any` casts.
- Auto-merge can duplicate the same declaration twice in one scope when both
  sides added equivalent code independently. Silent for git, caught by
  typecheck. Same hazard for duplicated object keys in config/manifest files —
  those can break install before any test runs.
- Cssltd code may rely on ambient context (async-local storage, globally-set
  flags, process env) being populated at a lifecycle moment that upstream
  refactors away. If Cssltd behaviour reads ambient state during init, forked
  work, or event handlers, check the refactor still establishes that state at
  the right time. Fix by restoring the ambient state, or by threading the
  needed value through explicitly.
- Tests that intercept via process-global or module-global spies can become
  no-ops after upstream moves the intercepted code path through dependency
  injection. The production code no longer touches the spied symbol. Fixing
  the test usually means injecting a mock at the new seam rather than tweaking
  the spy.
- When Cssltd extends a shared data shape with extra optional fields, different
  serialization paths for that shape can diverge on whether missing values are
  omitted or emitted as null. Parity tests between two such paths break on
  every Cssltd addition — audit the encoding assumption before adding fields.
- Rule ordering in allowlist/permission evaluation is usually last-match-wins.
  Re-declaring a catch-all rule "for safety" in a later ruleset silently
  overrides more specific allow rules from an earlier ruleset. Treat a
  redundant catch-all as destructive, not defensive.
- Upstream-added tests can encode a design contract Cssltd deliberately breaks.
  The test passes upstream because upstream doesn't share Cssltd's requirement.
  Decide between refactoring Cssltd to match the upstream contract or rewriting
  the test to assert Cssltd's divergent contract — with a `cssltdcode_change`
  marker explaining the divergence.
- CI and local can show different test failures. Tests that read user-local
  state (home dir, global config, auth tokens) pass in one environment but
  fail in the other. A green local run does not imply green CI.
- Dependency manifests and lockfiles move together. When the merge edits one,
  regenerate and commit the other in the same change — otherwise CI breaks on
  the follow-up setup step.
